So you wanna branch-n-merge?

1. How to make a NEW branch:
  git branch branch-name-here
    ðŸ‘† this will "branch off of" whatever branch you're on
       typically, we branch off main
2. How to switch to the branch you just made:
  git checkout branch-name-here
3. Write some code on your new branch. Make some commits on the new branch.
4. How to merge the new commits from your new branch back into main:
  git checkout main
    ðŸ‘† this switches back to the main branch
  git merge --no-ff branch-name-here
    ðŸ‘† this creates a new commit that merges your new branch
       into the main branch. DON'T FORGET HOW TO EXIT VIM!

At any point, you can do the following command if you need to know
for sure what branch you are on:
  git branch
